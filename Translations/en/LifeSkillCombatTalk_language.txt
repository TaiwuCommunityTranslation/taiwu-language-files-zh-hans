Don't worry about me, choose whatever you're comfortable with
Sorry, sorry...
If you're so knowledgeable, why are you sweating so much?
Please make yourself comfortable
So be it, no regretting
Please advise me
What does {0} mean? How do you explain it?
Do you actually understand {0}?
This is the easiest part of {0}, so let me explain it to you.
{0} is so profound, I really don't understand it...
...
Your fine art skills are excellent, I admit defeat
Your Excellency is...
As expected, I'm the best!
In that case, have you heard of this matter?
You really know what you are talking about
Your Excellency is so highly talented. it would be such a shame if something happened to you
What about this matter? Don't be so cautious, just speak freely
How can a man lose his dignity for small gains when he walks in the world?
How can i accept this? I'm not a greedy person
(They concentrate on art and don't respond)
You wanna win so badly? Heh, I won't let you
You want to buy me with this little thing?
You shouldn't worry about me, I have never been wronged in my travels for many years
I'm sorry for your trouble, but now we need to concentrate on the art
What do you mean by that? I am very confused
You're threatening me with this? Ridiculous
You should watch your back. would be a shame if you got disemboweled
With your skill, how were you expecting to compete?
You're such a well-known person, i wouldn't dare to win against you
I see that your skills have never been better.
You are too good, i admit defeat
Years of hard work are not in vain
Do you remember what happened before?
You are really extraordinary. I wonder if these things can make it easier for you?
I advise you to admit defeat as soon as possible, to avoid future complications and disasters...
