Layout
Your side's arguments increase the value of all your side's arguments on the horizontal, vertical and diagonal squares
chain
Increase the value of the argument of the current landing when answering the opponent's questions and rhetorical questions
Implementing
Your argument increases the argument value of all your fallen pieces in any horizontal or vertical square (blocked by your opponent's argument)
checks and balances
If the other side chooses to answer their own questions, rhetorical questions, reduce the value of the other side's arguments for this answer
attack by innuendo
Your side's argument can be reduced by all of your opponent's fallen arguments on the horizontal, vertical and diagonal squares
Sideswipe
Your side's argument can be reduced by all the arguments of your opponent in any horizontal or vertical frame
Intimidation
When your own questions and rhetorical questions are transformed into your own arguments, eliminate the opponent's fall on the horizontal, vertical and oblique one frame with low arguments
Defamation
You can use it to eliminate one of your opponent's discs on a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal square that has a lower argument than your own.
reprimand
When your own questions and rhetorical questions are turned into your own arguments, eliminate the horizontal and vertical arbitrary frames of the opponent's arguments that are low (do not cross the opponent's arguments that are high)
foreshadowing
When your question or rhetorical question is answered, the book used by the opponent for the answer increases the cooldown by one turn
exaggerate
When your side asks a question or rhetorical question, 3 more books are displayed to enter the cooldown
hide behind a false cover
When your side asks a question or rhetorical question, 3 less books are displayed to go into cooldown
Insight
Can be used on an argument where the opponent has used a strategy to directly eliminate the effect of all strategies in this frame
Misinterpretation
The effect of the strategy of eliminating all the opponent's arguments on the horizontal, vertical and diagonal frames when your own questions and rhetorical questions are transformed into your own arguments
Understanding
When your own questions and rhetorical questions become your own arguments, the strategy effect of eliminating all the opponent's arguments in any horizontal or vertical frame
Thoughtful
Reduce the cooldown of three of your books for one turn at random after use
enrage
Increase the cooldown of the opponent's three books for one turn after use
Inspiration
You can designate a book that is on cooldown to completely restore cooldown.
Bo citation
When your own questions and rhetorical questions are transformed into your own arguments, the strategy is based on the number of your arguments on the horizontal, vertical and oblique cells.
side quotation
The same number of strategies can be used to draw on your side's arguments based on this grid score
direct lead
When your own question or rhetorical question is turned into your own argument, the strategy is to extract the number of your own arguments according to the horizontal and vertical arbitrary grid (blocked by your opponent's argument)
compound theory
You may land on your side's argument, reclaim all of your side's strategies for that argument, and replace that argument with this landing status
Conclusion
The book used by your team will not increase the number of turns
powerful theory
You can ask questions on the opponent's arguments that are low, and turn them directly into your own arguments
