Start
Start of this Breakthrough.
End
End of this Breakthrough.\nAll progress will be lost if you cannot reach this cell.
Profound Theory
No Description
Normal
No special effect.
Succession
After connecting to this cell, <color=#brightblue>the Success Rate of all surrounding cells will be increased by 30%.</color>
Flexibility
After connecting to this cell, your next connection <color=#orange>must be a breakthrough cell 2 cells away.</color>
Mara
After connecting to this cell, all the "Basic" cells around this cell will change to random "Special" breakthrough cells
Foundation
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 100%.</color>\nAll surrounding cells' <color=#brightblue>Success Rate is increased by 60%.</color>
Transition
After connecting to this cell, the next 1 connection <color=#brightblue>will be guaranteed to succeed.</color>
Inspiration
Connecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>doesn't consume Talent Limit or Obsession Limit.</color>
Selflessness
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 30%</color>, but <color=#brightblue>connecting to it doesn't consume Talent Limit or Obsession Limit.</color> After connecting to this cell, 1 random "Basic" cell around it will change to "Selflessness".
Reversal
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 60%.</color>\nWhen connecting to this cell, <color=#brightblue>Talent Limit +3.</color>
Steady
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 60%.</color> For every 1 connected cell around this cell, this cell's <color=#brightblue>Success Rate is increased by 20%, and its Power Limit is increased by +1.</color>
Hard Work
After connecting to this cell, the surrounding cells' <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 50%</color>, but their <color=#brightblue>Power Limit is increased by +2, and if the connection fails, they won't become unconnectable.</color>
Clarity
After connecting to this cell, <color=#brightblue>many unrevealed cells will be revealed.</color>
Robbery
After connecting to this cell, <color=#brightred>3 random cells around it will become unconnectable</color>, and their <color=#brightblue>Power Limits will be transferred to this cell.</color>
Simplify
This cell's <color=#brightblue>Success Rate is increased by 30%.</color>\nAfter connecting to this cell, all "Special" cells around it will change into "Basic" cells.
Support
After connecting to this cell, all surrounding cells' <color=#brightblue>Power Limit is increased by +1.</color>
Culmination
After connecting to this cell, <color=#brightblue>Talent Limit +3</color>, and <color=#brightred>Power Limit of surrounding cells will change to 0.</color>
Humility
The more the current Talent exceeds half of the Talent Limit, the more this cell's and its surrounding cells' <color=#brightblue>Success Rate will increase</color>.
Ambition
The lower the current Talent compared to half of the Talent Limit, the more this cell's and its surrounding cells' <color=#brightblue>Success Rate will increase</color>.
Trick
After connecting to this cell, your next connection  <color=#orange>can connect to any other "Trick" cell as the target.</color>
Complete
You are already familiar with the key points of this technique.\nThis cell <color=#brightblue>will always connect successfully</color>.
Mistake
Already suffered setbacks on this cell.\nThis cell's <color=#brightblue>Success Rate will be increased by 100%</color>, but <color=#brightred>you will always lose Health when connecting it</color>, regardless of its success or failure.
