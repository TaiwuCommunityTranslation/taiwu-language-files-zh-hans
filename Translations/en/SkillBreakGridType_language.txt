Start of this Breakthrough.
End
End of this Breakthrough.\nAll progress will be lost if you cannot reach this cell.
Summary
No Description
Normal
No special effect.
Succession
After connecting to this cell, <color=#brightblue>Success Rate of all surrounding cells will be increased by 30%</color>.
Flexibility
For every successfully connected cell around this cell, <color=#brightblue>this cell's Success Rate will be increased by 30%</color>.
Perseverence
For every failed connection around this cell, <color=#brightblue>this cell's Success Rate will be increased by 60%</color>.
Foundation
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 100%</color>.\n<color=#brightblue>Success Rate of all cells surrounding this cell will be increased by 60%</color>.
Transition
After connecting to this cell, <color=#brightblue>1 next connection will always be successful</color>.
Inspiration
Connecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>won't increase attempt count</color>.
Refreshment
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 30%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will reduce attempt count by 1</color>.
Reversal
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 60%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will reduce attempt count by 2</color>.
Steady
This cell's <color=#brightblue>Success Rate is increased by 60%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightred>will increase attempt count by 1</color>.
Hard Work
This cell's <color=#brightblue>Success Rate is increased by 100%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightred>will increase attempt count by 2</color>.
Clarity
Connecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will reveal multiple undiscovered cells</color>.
Challenge
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 60%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>restores all failed surrounding cells</color>.
Simplify
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 30%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell will turn all "special cells" around this cell into "basic cells"
Support
When you connect to this cell, 1 unconnected "golden" cell will be transferred to one of the "basic" cells around it.
Culmination
Connecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will reduce attempt count by 3</color>.\nBut <color=#brightred>1 unconnected "golden cell" will turn into a "basic cell"</color>.
Humility
The higher the attempt count is than half of the Talent limit, the more <color=#brightblue>Success Rate of this cell and all surrounding cells will increase</color>.
Ambition
The lower the attempt count is than half of the Talent limit, the more <color=#brightblue>Success Rate of this cell and all surrounding cells will increase</color>.
Advice
Connecting to this cell <color=#brightred>will increase attempt count by 1</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will immediately connect 1 unconnected "golden cell"</color>.
Complete
You are already familiar with the key points of this technique.\nThis cell <color=#brightblue>will always connect successfully</color>.
Mistake
Already suffered setbacks on this cell.\nThis cell's <color=#brightblue>Success Rate will be increased by 100%</color>.\nBut <color=#brightred>you will always lose Health when connecting to this cell, regardless of it's success or failure</color>.
