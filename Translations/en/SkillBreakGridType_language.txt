End of this Breakthrough. \nAll progress will be lost if you cannot reach this cell.
Summary
No Description
Normal
No special effect.
Succession
After connecting to this cell, <color=#brightblue>Success Rate of all surrounding cells will be increased by 30%</color>.
Flexibility
For every successfully connected cell around this cell, <color=#brightblue>this cell's Success Rate will be increased by 30%</color>.
Perseverence
For every failed connection around this cell, <color=#brightblue>this cell's Success Rate will be increased by 60%</color>.
Foundation
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 100%</color>.\n<color=#brightblue>Success Rate of all cells surrounding this cell will be increased by 60%</color>.
Transition
After connecting to this cell, <color=#brightblue>1 next connection will always be successful</color>.
Inspiration
Connecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>won't increase attempt count</color>.
Refreshment
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 30%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will reduce attempt count by 1</color>.
Reversal
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 60%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will reduce attempt count by 2</color>.
Steady
This cell's <color=#brightblue>Success Rate is increased by 60%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightred>will increase attempt count by 1</color>.
Hard Work
This cell's <color=#brightblue>Success Rate is increased by 100%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightred>will increase attempt count by 2</color>.
Clarity
Connecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will reveal multiple undiscovered cells</color>.
Challenge
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 60%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>restores all failed surrounding cells</color>.
Simplify
This cell's <color=#brightred>Success Rate is decreased by 30%</color>.\nConnecting to this cell will turn all "special cells" around this cell into "basic cells"
Support
When you connect to this cell, 1 unconnected "golden" cell will be transferred to one of the "basic" cells around it.
Culmination
Connecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will reduce attempt count by 3</color>.\nBut <color=#brightred>1 unconnected "golden cell" will turn into a "basic cell"</color>.
Humility
The higher the attempt count is than half of the Talent limit, the more <color=#brightblue>Success Rate of this cell and all surrounding cells will increase</color>.
Ambition
The lower the attempt count is than half of the Talent limit, the more <color=#brightblue>Success Rate of this cell and all surrounding cells will increase</color>.
Advice
Connecting to this cell <color=#brightred>will increase attempt count by 1</color>.\nConnecting to this cell <color=#brightblue>will immediately connect 1 unconnected "golden cell"</color>.
Complete
You are already familiar with the key points of this technique.\nThis cell <color=#brightblue>will always connect successfully</color>.
Mistake
Already suffered setbacks on this cell.\nThis cell's <color=#brightblue>Success Rate will be increased by 100%</color>.\nBut <color=#brightred>you will always lose Health when connecting to this cell, regardless of it's success or failure</color>.
