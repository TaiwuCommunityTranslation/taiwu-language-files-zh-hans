The people of the West all come here to make offerings....
The Infinite Vajrayana sect believes in dual practice and that when a man and a woman are in harmony, they will achieve enlightenment.
This.... such obscene words.... or do not say....
What is the reason for this......
It's Nature....
When the senior monks of the Infinite Vajra Sect pass away, their flesh will turn into a heavenly rainbow and fly away.
I don't know where to fly to? Could it be the Western land of bliss....
I didn't have the chance to see....
This is the image of the death of a senior monk, I have also seen....
When the water of the four seas is filled with the four precious bottles and poured on the emperor's roof, it will make the country prosperous.
This statement is unheard of to me.... Is this really the case?
Since this is the case.... how to be born in a chaotic world....
If a person without an initiation practices the Infinite Vajra Sect, and observes its texts, he will go to hell.
It is so sinister.... If you enter the Vajra Sect, you have to be careful....
There is such a statement....
As it should be....
The Five Immortals Church
The Five Immortals Church built a mountain fortress, from the foot of the mountain up the trend, a thousand families connected, water over the door.
From what you say, it is a very peaceful place....
Not the same as Midland Architecture....
It is indeed my Miaozhai....
The Five Immortals Church congregation is also a vertebrate fishermen and hunters, the Church within the whistle, the congregation gathered.
Do they farm, fish and hunt too? It's not what I thought....
So.... is nothing special either....
Indeed as you said....
The Five Immortals worship nature, and insect and animal totems can be found everywhere on their mountains and rocks.
It's scary to have insects as a totem!
Indeed appalling....
What is so appalling about insects.... I often serve them....
The Five Immortals Church is based on the valley, which is humid and infested with poisonous snakes, people have no access.
There is something so horrible in the world!
It is better to set foot less in the Five Immortals....
We have our own defense....
Five Immortals Church congregation often put the compulsion at the bottom of the bowl, a person holding the bowl, then will be compelled.
This.... is so vicious.... fortunately you told to me....
This method is also poisonous....
This method does circulate in the Church....
Five immortal religion famous black seedlings, mostly good at poisonous compulsion, but the life expectancy is not long, the population is thin.
Listen to what you say.... will know its insidious and horrible place.... future natural careful....
What you gain must be lost....
Five Immortals Church after the valley there is a spring, the color of the spring often changes, which has a very poisonous.
Five Immortals Church poisonous coiled, poisonous water flowing, really weird....
The Five Immortals are everywhere there is a strong poison....
Compulsion cave is the five immortal religion hatching insect compulsion place, the cave poisonous insects are rampant, five poisons with.
The parasite is quite harmful, if there is an opportunity, perhaps you can explore the truth....
The parasite is actually hatched out....
The compulsion cave is a holy place....
Where the practice of compulsion is refined, hush to the air, look at the eyes, are able to transmit its poison to people.
How is this good! I wonder what precautions can be taken....
It is indeed difficult to prevent....
There is indeed such a person in the Church....
KAI Green Gate sighting
The east side of the boundary green cliff is made of stone in the shape of open teeth, and there are wells and mortars still exist, which used to be a refuge for bandits and thieves.
In this way.... but there is a similarity with the peach blossom source....
Bandits and thieves.... killers.... are also considered similar....
This is an old story....
Boundary green cliff does not produce grass, rainwater accumulates in the stone, the disciples will go to the stone to get water.
Water in the sky, spring in the stone, I wonder what the difference is....
It's no different from ordinary spring water....
Boundary green cliff cliff on the sharp rocks, many strange shape, often people die because of this.
The stone can actually kill, no wonder it is not the place where the boundary green door is located....
If you are not careful, you will lose your life since....
The cave of the Green Cliff of the boundary, everywhere is unobstructed, once people enter it, there is no trace.
So that's it! Is it often missing its trace....
It turns out it's the cave that's to blame....
Boundary green cliff east, sharp stones protruding order into a ladder, straight and up, people called forget life.
So difficult.... apes, birds of prey fear can not walk unharmed....
If you take this ladder, you should be careful....
People walk on it, life and death in a flash....
The monument at the top of the Boundary Green Cliff: How high is the standing place? The stars are below. People call it a stargazing cliff.
The stars are even under the feet.... boundary Qingmen has been in the Palace of Heaven....
It is so high....
Stand on it, the stars are under your feet....
Stargazing cliff under the mountain rocks into caves, cave lights shaking, is a ghost in the light.
The ghosts use the cave as a home, also know how to light a lamp? That's an interesting story....
Maybe it's the light of a firefly....
界青崖下深渊有异兽，以人尸体为食，常可闻其嚼骨声。
你说的如此可怖……不知那到底是什么异兽……
实在可怖……
崖下或有猛兽……
名仙人手者，在无生渊底，人不能至，登之可得仙人应。
不知是否真有人至仙人手……是否真有仙人应之……
不知何人能至其上……
只是传言而已……
伏龙坛之见闻
赤明岛有一山孤立，其时而喷云吐雾，海天便赤红一色。
听闻赤明岛上真龙盘踞，莫非便是此因……
无怪非称作赤明……
岛中常常如此……
赤明岛上石柱纵列，高耸入云，色多灰黑，触之灼肤。
竟有此物……我可记下了……
嗯……自是记下了……
火山之旁，山石本就灼热……
赤明岛中有泉水沸腾，其味刺鼻，物掷其间，则熟。
竟有如此滚烫的泉水……实在少见……
不知味道如何……
乃火山炙烤之故……
赤明岛垒土屋，以沟壑隔人户，熔浆绕城仿佛流火不灭。
熔浆绕城……流火不灭……不知是什么景象……
确是奇观……
伏龙坛历来如此，倒不如何稀奇……
赤明岛熔浆汇于池中，流动翻腾，从不凝固，人称火池。
我见过山泉河流冰池……到从未听闻过火池……
不知与汤泉有何不同……
熔浆不凝，乃是因为高温之故……
赤明岛火山口处，有状若金龙之地纹，人言其为神迹。
地面竟有龙纹，或许真是神迹！
如此神奇……或许便是神迹……
自是神迹……
金龙殿立于火山山口，殿内只摆满金龙，仆从时时擦拭。
这是为何？金龙又有何含义……
伏龙坛竟有如此财富……
至节日，伏龙坛岛主便以金龙掷火山中，以求真龙护佑。
世间难道真有真龙？否则伏龙坛又何故如此……
真龙祖师定有归来之时便是……
赤明岛地底有轰然声，仿佛龙吟，又有地震，乃龙翻身。
世间竟真有龙么？\n那必然十分巨大，否则怎能载千万万人……
居于龙身之上，实需勇气……
我自然有所听闻……
血犼教之见闻
血犼教地僻林深，入谷下上跻攀，常遇飞蛭、沙虱之物。
从未见过如此阴冷恐怖之处……
实在偏僻阴冷……
不过寻常虫豸……
血犼谷雾起赤红色。其红雾中含有剧毒，人兽触而死。
世间竟还有如此毒物，实在让人难防……
此处……倒十分适合血犼教……
血犼教自有防御之法……
入血犼谷狭窄，犹如一线，持火把行，蝙蝠便扑炬而出。
血犼教所在之处实在……不同与常人……
哦……我且记下了……
蝙蝠见光便起，有何奇怪……
血犼殿山石嶙峋，殿首血犼喷火食人，最阴森诡异。
便是听你说来，也觉恐怖至极……
我可不愿踏足……
自然是煊赫雄伟……
血犼教置铁栏关押人畜，其中常见人畜争食，撕咬搏击。
血犼教竟如斯残忍！实乃江湖败类！
我还未曾见过如此景象……
畜栏……畜栏……人与畜生本无差别……
血犼谷有石孔为泉，偶有血水穿石如线，便腥气弥漫。
这是什么缘故？！血犼教如此阴诡……
竟如此阴诡……
教中血水常见，何须惊奇……
血犼教上空常有乌鸦盘桓，或言人语，传言乃食人之故。
这？！血犼教竟如斯可怖……
竟如此可怖……
乌鸦本就啄食腐尸为生……
血池乃是血犼教之禁地，相传人入其中，便见相枢。
那血池之中有什么玄机……血犼教处处不同寻常……
相枢有何好见……
可惜我却不曾见到相枢……
血犼谷有色赤红，如马而有鳞者，口中喷火，焚谷烧林。
这是何物？！血犼谷中竟有神兽护持么……
或许是什么神兽吧……
血犼教早有传言，此乃血犼……
音律之见闻
听蔡氏五弄，便见春、观水、怀幽、生愁、思秋。
果真如此？实在堪称奇异……
我却还另有见解……
音乐影响五感，是最为平常的……
音乐可以影响人心，奸声使人恶，正声使人善。
如此……我自当听听……是否能让善人变，恶人变善……
依我所见……此中或许另有门道……
此事早有定论，何必多言……
怒意滔滔淹鬼神，恨意滚滚没天地，闻曲如身在其中。
你我虽非曲中人，却也生出曲中意？\n谱写此曲之人定然技法高超……
听闻此曲乃是在乱世所谱……
此中自然是有些技法的……
唐朝歌舞与此时歌舞不同，浪漫奇彩，博纳万家。
果真！？我向往盛唐舞曲许久，却无缘得见……
若有机会倒也可以看看……
嗯，自然是好……
《碣石调·幽兰》声微而志远，非志洁行芳者无法领略。
能弹奏出如此音乐之人……定然抱负不凡！
原来如此么？难怪……
不知音律者便不能知其妙……
听闻广陵散，心中自生豪迈潇洒，又不觉悲来。
可惜呀……不闻昔日嵇康所奏……是我之憾事……
我听来也是如此……
理应是如此……
盛世谱霓裳，曲终而国破、人散，人言其不祥之曲。
一国之盛衰……与歌舞又有何干系？
天下之势，分久必合，合久必分……
你知晓便可……
敦煌曲谱载录了许多古老、失传已久的音律与曲谱。
只是听说……此书十分晦涩，咸少有人可以看懂……
那倒十分珍贵……
你自当熟记便是……
书载猗兰操、残形操等失传之乐谱，乃是琴音之始。
我已仰慕此书许久……希望自己的技艺更加精益……
我也听闻过此书的大名……
所言亦不算虚……
弈棋之见闻
书中言：不得贪胜。乃是步步为营，心如止水之理。
竟还有这样的道理！那我定然要试试的……
此言也有些道理……倒不能心急……
既入此门，这些道理早已烂熟于心……
围棋之戏，乃属兵家之类。置棋围城，便是得胜。
你说来简单……我却还有不明之处，可否在与我仔细讲讲……
调兵遣将、步步为营、至于围城，岂不正属兵家……
嗯，也可如此说道……
书中行棋如行军，以巧诈，以谨审，审时而度势。
从此中……似乎能看出一些兵法之道……
这些方法我也有所耳闻……
这些都是围棋中常用之法……
《媪妇谱》在于：出“棋”不意，先人一“手”。
围棋千变万化……令人称奇……
似乎确实如此……
既知此理，或许能与人一较……
棋有三论：弈旨、弈势、棋品序，能悟其一，已称无敌。
弈旨既称三论之首，想比定有不凡之处！
哦……早闻其大名，若有机会……
棋势千变万化……
书中醴泉图及五车势等图谱棋势，先招后手，令人称奇。
这便是围棋圣手吧……任是旁人也如何想不出的……
若有机会……你我倒可一同打谱……
棋理玄奥，便是如此……
棋势正合严谨，以奇诡而胜；不思而应，则必取败。
听来十分玄奥……博弈之道确实难懂……
是这个道理……确实玄妙……
嗯，便是如此……
书中始用顺手炮、列手炮之战术，棋攻棋杀，从无败局。
这些我都未曾听说过……当真从无败局！
其中或许有什么妙处……
自有妙处所在……
相传此局乃天宫棋谱，古往今来，至今无人能解此局。
便连刘仲甫亦呕血数升……看来，传言不虚……
或许真有一人能解此局……
世间并无无解之棋局……
诗书之见闻
书中载录唐朝居处、器物、服馔，与今日有所不同。
唐时什么模样？难道他们与我们所用器物不同么……
似乎不如我们方便……
可予小儿阅读……
书中词句朗朗上口，黄口小儿亦能倒背如流。
书中有些道理……能让孩童知道也是好的……
我似乎曾经听过有孩童唱念……
韵律相谐，自然如此……
书中将史籀、李斯、蔡邕、王羲之等人的书法列作神品。
他们的书法又有何妙处……比之我难道有何不同……
他们几人的书法确实有不同寻常之处……
倒也无可非议……
赵构清逸流宕，秀异而特立，可谓得六朝书法之大成。
我却无缘得见……不知是怎样的妙笔……
我也临摹过他的字帖……确实如你所言……
亦是经年累月之功……
运笔在于力、势、藏，知此三，便体法百变，也得灵韵。
早听闻《九势》之妙，看来我还得再研读研读……
我近日也在钻研此三点……
此三点，我已知晓……
众人闻书垂泪，无不辄叹：生人作死别，恨恨那可论。
叫人叹息……每想到此，总是忍不住……
想来定是写的极好……否则怎能催人泪下……
书者笔法极妙……方能如此……
凡写楷书者，皆以永字为起笔，循“永”字八法而书。
所言极是……我见有些孩童自小便书写永字……
真是如此么？或许我也可以看看此书……
我自比你还要清楚一些……
藏地百姓将格萨尔王视为旷世英雄，对其十分尊崇。
只听说过他的名号……\n对于其人却并不是十分了解，你若有机会或许可以同我说说……
那定然是一位英明的君王吧……
四字蔽此书：雅俗正集。音，情，歌尽于此三百篇中。
既能为宗庙听之……亦能为百姓唱之……\n可不正是雅俗正集！
此书的价值自然非平常书籍可比……
绘画之见闻
不见画作，但闻《图画歌》，便能知七分形象。
如此神奇……\n想必作者定对这些化作十分了解，否则怎能写出如此契合的词句……
如此么？那我有机会倒要看看他所言之画作……
我见过诸多名作，早知其面目……
黄休复为编撰此书，行遍蜀地，寻访了众多寺院。
若非是他……天下人哪里知道蜀地还有如此名作……
如此精神毅力，叫我辈自叹不如……
天下壁画我见过许多，不止蜀地……
今时之山水画作，大都受此书影响，然无人能越其藩篱。
似乎如此……众人只肯模仿，难以创新……
风景总是不同的……
虽然如此，亦有创举……
此画前，所绘无非梅兰竹菊，此画后，甫有生灵百态。
此言对极！天下人皆爱些梅兰竹菊，鱼虾鸟雀……
梅兰竹菊好，牛儿驴儿也好……
这我是知晓的……
此书记载许多名家，当时不闻于世，如今已是众人皆知。
此书作者竟有如此慧眼，可惜他已不在人世……
倒不知是邓椿慧眼，还是人云亦云……
你说那人，我也知晓……
书中所绘妇人，身心并正，人观之，不敢生亵渎之心。
我也有所耳闻，画中所绘具是些仁德的女子，\n只是世间真有这样的画作？
人若不见，定以为你夸大其词……其实不然……
顾恺之之作，自是神形具备……
九天阊阖开宫殿,万国衣冠拜冕旒。唐之气魄具在此中。
这样的图画……这样的盛唐……只是一眼，便已让我心向往之……
只听你所言，便觉十分恢弘……
其间自有技巧所在……
汴京百态，巨细无遗，人情风貌，宛如眼前。
或许可以让我祖辈瞧瞧……他们定然也想再见见曾经的汴京……
若有机会，我也想看上一看……毕竟那是汴京……
嗯，所言正是……
画中洛神瑰姿艳逸，仪静体闲……非是图画，真乃洛神。
你说的如此传神……我也想见一见……
难怪乎有人千金求之……
我自然是见过的……
术数之见闻
古人常以金口诀预测吉凶祸福，断言古今未来。
你也会这金口诀么？可否给我也预测预测吉凶……
有准的么……？
或许能念予黄口小儿知……
以此书预测命数往来，或有应验者。
街头那些算命的术士，莫非读的也是此书……有时也是准的……
总有不准的地方……
或许你能与算命术士探讨……
奇门遁甲共十八局，可为行军布阵之用，则如神鬼襄助。
如此，我可定要熟读才是，如今世道……何处不是行军……
我亦有验算……确实有神妙之处……
其中道理，我已然知晓……
昔日钦天监以紫微斗数测王朝命数，已言到至今。
既然如此，为何不避害？还是因为避无可避……
如此看来，这紫微斗数实在厉害……
甚至早有破解之法，然又如何……
在单于之岁，岁星在子，会与虚、危二星宿共升共落。
还有如此奇观！只是这是什么道理……
星宿又如此景象，其中或许有道理可依……
确实有如此星象……
星宿升落、日月变幻，皆与国运、人势息息相关。
这其中有什么道理？明明日月星辰居于苍穹，离我们甚远……
我认为有些道理……
此言依据我是知晓的……
此书谓五行之始，所创大小九州。言其为窥天探地之书。
天地玄妙，能窥一二，已是了不得……
那……真是一本奇书呢……
此书所用又岂止如此……
时逢圣人，《河图洛书》乃出，人皆视其为天命瑞应。
听说只有在伏羲与大禹在位时，方才出现过……
如此珍贵的书籍，难道你见过？
嗯……是有如此言传……
《周易》广博，在乎教人明达知礼，在乎教人卜筮知命。
如今我倒知晓了此书为何被称为大道之源……
但知其一已是了不得了……
如此，你自要常阅才是……
品鉴之见闻
茶水之美，贵在于茶，更在于水。
若有机会，你与我说说这天下的水有何不同……
天下的水都有不同，自然各有各的好……
识茶之人皆知此理……
书中载有醉乡。献酒千钟，可借道姑射山，而至醉乡。
那里定然有千百壶美酒，人人长醉……不愿醒……
我可不愿去什么醉乡，此处最好不过……
你若有意，前往便是……
书中论汤器：金银称富贵，石琢称秀碧，铜铁称缠口。
金银亦可盛茶汤？我原以为只有酒水才与盛其相关……
其中我最爱以……饮茶……滋味清新……
这也并非什么奇闻……
书中言茶：百草之首奉天子；言酒：玉酒琼浆通贵人。
这说的仿佛都对……然茶酒总归不同，我便更喜爱……
茶叶好，酒也好，我都喜爱……
然水最不可缺之……
书中论茶色，纯白为上，青白次，灰白次之，黄白又次。
如此……我可记下了，下次再也不会叫人诓骗了去……
我却咸少见到纯白的茶色……
嗯，倒也一字不差……
冬月酿酒，便抱瓮而待，少顷既成。此法少于人知。
与我听说的酿酒的确不同，也不知所酿造的酒是什么味道……
嗯……我有所耳闻，只是不曾尝试……
如此所酿成之酒……却是佳酿无疑……
书中言：水虽有喜恶，但无论次第。乃是最为公允。
我也觉在理……也不必评出个高下……
无论井水、江水……皆有可取之处……
自然……
糯粳相糅，杂以花卉为饼，乃成曲，制酒而为精酿。
这样的酒曲我并不曾听过……似乎我其它酒曲不同……
我倒尝试过……只是并不易成……
说来容易，做来却是不易……
其品评天下茶叶，言峡州、光州为上，易州、幽州为下。
难怪茶味有所不同……原是产地不一……
嗯……似乎正是如此……
天下品茶者皆奉其为圭臬……
锻造之见闻
鼎身纹饰乃是以锤揲、錾刻之法雕刻而成。
原是用了如此方法……故而纹饰精美……
锤揲、錾刻之法却也不算太难……
锤揲、錾刻之法，已不是秘闻……
矿石之所在、质地不同，所用木柴、火势也有差异。
这是为何？难道就没有一劳永逸之法么？
我曾见过……似乎如此……
我曾亲眼见过……亦操持过……
书中载录帝王、名将之刀剑四十余件，有其主之风。
你快同我说说有哪些刀剑？又是哪些将军的？
载录倒颇为详实……
复刻也并非难事……
书中言相剑：剑色黄白相杂，则坚牣，乃为良剑。
你似乎十分了解刀剑，若有机会也要请你为我相看相看……
我可要好好记下……
这确实是相剑法门之一……
九州有百条江河，其水可以铸龙泉，可循之而往。
江河总有干涸的时候……此事还是少人知道为好……
难道你知道是哪些江河么？
我早已一一验证……
越王五剑乃藏于山之高处、水至深处、地之低处。
那又是什么地方？你待我仔细琢磨琢磨……
我似乎已经参透其一……
造物不仅在于技艺高低，更关乎天时、地利。
我还是第一次听见这种说法，细想也有一些道理……
天时？地利？所言似乎甚广……
制造器物，我自然知晓各中道理……
以山之锡，溪之铜，铸炉烈火所铸之剑，坚利堪比神兵。
听你此言……你也锻造出过么？
听起来便十分厉害……
这确是铸剑之关窍所在……
有火可以熔玉，与铜铁铸造，尽得玉、铜、铁之优。
难道世上真有如此秘法！我从来不曾听人说过……
我也不知……究竟是否谣传……
确有此法流传……
制木之见闻
朽木若以巧工，则皆可以雕琢。
朽木皆可雕也？这说法也有趣……
那儿正有一块朽木，你可以试试能不能雕琢……
这并非是什么奇事……
世间花草林木，皆有用处，衣食住行，不可或缺。
你这般说来……我才注意……却是如此……
你实在观察细微……
我皆有涉猎便是……
商朝以后，车饰文采，舟以刻镂，不仅牢固而已。
听闻豪奢之家还会在舟车之上镶嵌珍宝……引人追逐……
自然还是牢固最为重要……
其中技法并不算高超……
书中所载不仅可以制木，亦能作用于民生。
啊？我倒不曾听人说起……或许你可以同我说说……
或许我也知道……
故而书中字句，我已是倒背如流……
其中机关巧制，令人称奇，若有悟性者，或可以再现。
鲁班的奇思妙想，今人又哪里及得上……何谈再现？
难道你便是那有悟性者？
其实并无什么难处……
天圆地方，可以度量；昼长夜短，变化有常。
不知道能有什么方法度量出天地的宽广……
度量天地，好大的口气……
我又何尝不知……
书中所载规制正大，少于奇淫技巧，非民间技艺可比。
毕竟是皇家宫苑……听闻昔日建造皇城的工匠便读过此书……
奇淫技巧亦有奇淫技巧的乐趣……
二者皆善，不宜相提并论……
顺地势、天时所造机关，非天时、地利、人和不能破解。
听闻此书作者曾督造秦始皇陵？秦始皇陵至今无人知晓……
如此……确实难以破解……
榫卯结构，无论宫室、家具均可严密扣合，致天衣无缝。
不用铁钉固定么？这如何可以……
其中妙处，实在令人叹服……
所言不差……
医术之见闻
读《脉经》，可以知病。
那人人皆应当读《脉经》，或许能避免许多疾病……
知道又如何？并不能医治……
平民百姓亦可阅览……
读《褚氏遗书》，可以除小疾。
若能及早知晓病痛，应当能及时医治……
哦……只是不能断言恶疾……
那你必要细读才是……
知难而解其难，则其中所述八十一难，皆不谓难。
咦……那你倒说说，是哪八十一难，可以治什么病痛？
医家或许可以常阅……
这些已算是寻常……并不难于治疗……
凡有疾病者，皆可观此书对症下药，能解诸多杂症。
那可在家中备下此书，如此，便不用看医……
这……我倒有尝试……
或许仍是不及……
治病在于求本，究病根而除之，方不再犯，否则无谓。
此言自是在理！只是病根难查……
这是自然……只是病根难查……
是如此道理……
昔日曹操若肯开颅，其病未尝不能治。
华佗医术虽是超群，可这开颅之术前无古人，你又何出此言？
若然如此……天下少因病而亡者……
其中是有妙处……
书中经方要略，若为黎民知行，足以拯济疾苦。
听闻有不少药行皆用此书所载药方……
实乃造福百姓……
然又如何……
书中无凡草，烹药当论“君”，乃“不可缺之”。
那你可要与我说说，书上所载皆为何药？
难道真无有替代者？
确是这些……
知书而行者，终其天年，度百岁乃去。
长命百岁？世间真有此书？
若有此书……自然千金难买……
嗯，是有道理所在……
毒术之见闻
热瘴之地所生长蚊虫多有毒素，进林需着长衫。
我若前往热瘴之地，必然带长衫而往……
这我可记下了……
嗯，我是知晓的……
《毒经》中载有一类毒草，长于南方，人畜食而亡。
知道这毒物，我也可及时避过……
下次自要多加注意才是……
你多注意便是……
虽称洗冤，但为使毒者善用，则作下毒、解毒诸法。
你可知晓？若然知晓，也可同我说说那些下毒、解毒的法子……
这……莫要伤害旁人便好……
你也可以深究一番……
邪物论中载有鸩毒、牵机，毒性猛烈，无药可救。
竟如此可怖？那著书之人对毒物研究定然十分精妙……
如此烈性……确实胜过许多毒物……
若是毒物，便有解法…………
其中所载毒物不在于奇烈，而在于可以以毒攻毒。
听闻此书作者乃一僧人，著此书定当无甚害人之心……
那便是可以解诸多奇毒？
此事我自然知晓……
酒与毒物相生则柔，为慢性毒，相克则烈，为剧毒。
真有如此可怖？听你此言，我亦不敢饮酒了……
不知有无可解之法……
相生相克之理，并不难解……
书中载录一百二十五药材，作药中佐使，却是毒中君臣。
既为害人毒物，无怪乎为药中佐使……
医毒双生之理而已……
书中所列穴位不可擅用，损坏真源，妄造杀孽。
这便是伤敌一千自损八百？
毒术本就是自损之术……
你既知晓便好……
书中载云南、广南、淮南之三类毒物为上等，毒无可解。
这……世间竟真有不可解之毒么……
如此奇物……可遇不可求……
我已然知晓，倒不必多言……
织锦之见闻
花罗织造复杂，需以一人提花，另一人投梭。
原是如此织造……无怪乎花罗价高……
今日我倒是知晓了……
我是见过的……
黎锦多取色丝、吉贝织造，纺、织、染均与中原不同。
黎锦花色却与中原不同，原是以色丝、吉贝织造……
黎锦织衣想必也十分好看……
民族织染与中原不同，并不止黎锦……
玉石，如空青，花草，如柿叶，凡有色者，皆可作采色。
这些我日常皆可瞧见，原来还有如此妙用……
这些衣色我都曾见过……
便是这些……

我之前并不知晓……原来丝衣是如此制成的……

衣冠循之有法，则举止行之有礼。
如此……你我更要时时注意衣冠齐整……

如此……难道可以祈求家国安泰？
竟还有如此作用……
自古如此……
玉虽有美质，在于石间，不值良工琢磨，与瓦砾不别。
若无能工巧匠，石便不能成玉……
这些……我自然知晓……

你可去过？是否真如书中所写？
如此……或许可以前去……
外域亦有许多……并非中原……
宝石出西番、回鹘，不复加磨拭，而得天真。
无怪乎我不曾在山林中见过，原来乃是西域之物……
西番、回鹘离我们太远……
若从此业，这也不算奇石……
手工巧者，自然颖异不凡，眼到手点，成金玉石也。
能工巧匠，自然能变石为玉……难道你亦可以？
常常研习，或许可以达到如此境界……

真是如此么？只是身在江湖，并不能清净……
这……并非我能控制……
此乃居士养生所论……
黄金入火，毕天不朽，人服金丹，可令人不老不死。
不老不死……天下真有这样的金丹么？\n可我还有亲友爱人，又岂能不老不死……

凡事或许皆是如此……
原是如此道理……
嗯，书中是有此论……
列子贵虚尚玄，炼成御风术，可以御风而行，如若神人。
竟可以御风而行，那岂非神人？
他难道已得道成仙？

天地与我并生，而万物与我为一。
此话玄妙……我并无法参透，但我好似已知晓其意……
这……难道是如此意思么……
书中此论，我自有见解……
天生万物，天杀万物，乃道之理。
万物具乃天地所生……你我亦是，故生老病死……
为何生又要死……
道为天地之本，万物之源。
大道玄妙，你我皆不过一知半解……
道之玄妙……实在难悟……
道本来难以参透……

我是知晓的，不必细言……
