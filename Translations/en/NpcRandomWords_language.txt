"It is a blessing for a soldier to serve his country and die on the battlefield.\nIf they can die on the battlefield with their body wrapped in horse leather, it will be a blessing for our generation!"
"Haha! I haven't killed so happily in a long time!\nThey are just barbarians, they don't know their own strength. If you manage to step into Guangdong today,\nI will write my name upside down from then on!"
"I'm not as good at martial arts as my brothers in the sect, killing one is not bad, killing two is enough!"

“小镇不比大城，面对妖魔浩劫，难免力不从心……”
“相枢祸世，我亦不可慌乱，当务之急乃是安定人心……”
“近来传言妖魔出世，\n任他什么来路，我可不放在眼里！”
“营山设寨，本就是为避刀兵之祸，\n可这相枢妖魔，却是避无可避……”
“相枢将临，寨中鸡犬不宁，我也只能撑撑场面罢了……”

“少林本为佛门，虽与俗世无争，亦不忍见相枢降世，众生离乱……”
“众生饱受相枢之苦，我等自当以菩提渡世之心，勉力施为……”
“我听闻相枢乃‘万相之相’……\n可经中又说‘若见诸相非相，即见如来’，究竟何意？”
“少林虽不入红尘，然则如今众生危难，我等自不能作壁上观！”
“那相枢竟有如此神通，\n便是把归隐前辈尽数请来，亦未必能降住那魔头……”
“阿弥陀佛……若那相枢临世，只怕这人世将沦为阿鼻地狱……”

“近来异事频发，伤患日增，\n又风闻相枢之论，只怕这天下又要生乱……”
“清点药材，整理引子，\n如今伤患增多，可不能在这时候出了岔子……”
“近来病患增多，故而师父常无闲暇，难为我等授业解惑……”
“相枢之势日盛，敝谷也当早做准备，以防重蹈三百年前覆辙……”
“妖魔作乱，生灵皆受其害，我派自是秉承医者本心，悬壶济世……”
“如此乱世，医者责任重大，不知我何日才能学成出师，救死扶伤……”
“相枢真要再临，也不知我派能否如三百年前一般，侥幸得全……”

“不想我尚在学艺，便要医治如此重症，\n莫要紧张……且牢记师父所言……”
“如今天下纷扰，武当更应顺时而动，不可妄为……”
“江湖纷乱，百姓难安，如今正是下山证道之时……”

“相枢将至，我元山派若不挺身而出，更待何时！”
“妖魔现世，强敌当前，更不可一刻放松了修行……”
“生为百夫雄，死为壮士规……\n逢此危难之际，正当由我先行赴义！”
“如今唯有勠力同心，与相枢决一死战，方有一线生机！”
“我等早有死战之志，只待师尊一声令下……”
“狮相门世代镇守广东，若是真有邪魔胆敢祸乱海疆，我决不轻饶！”
“狮相门弟子只需勤加修习，上下一心，何惧什么妖邪？”
“我狮相门刀掌双绝！管他什么妖魔鬼怪，统统砍翻便是！”
“妖魔乱世，我等虽无所畏惧，周遭百姓亦不免恐慌，须得遣人镇抚……”
“听说已有同门被那些相枢爪牙所伤！哼，迟早得帮兄弟们讨回这个公道！”
“我近来新学得一手妙招，那相枢本领再大，定然也不会这一式！”
“祖上为国捐躯，我等怎敢愧对列祖列宗？\n待那相枢出世之日，便是我狮相门报效之时！”
“只要我狮相门一息尚存，那相枢就休想踏入疆土半步！”
“任那相枢本领通天，门主必将带领我等大破敌寇，我等只需谨遵号令便可！”
“自历代太吾除魔以来，相枢销声匿迹已久，难道方今之世，又应劫数……”
“妖魔作乱亦不过百年，于仙人眼中，只若弹指一挥间……”
“相枢长埋地下，我等求道登仙未果，何以过问地底之事？”
“相枢之患，须得尽早除之，否则恐将有碍我等登仙之梯……”
“近日云游四方，屡见妖魔伤人，莫非那相枢真要降世？”
“若待我等成仙之后，再来平定这相枢之祸，想必易如反掌……”
“相枢之劫终是来临，然山亦难独全，唯有以仙家法术应对……”
“只恨我未能求得仙道，虽是有心伏魔，却不知可有余力……”
“如今相枢当前，恐怕唯有仙人下凡，方可救世……”
“相枢确实非同小可，但钻研‘一明珏’之事，同样不能放下……”
“我等久居神女峰中，鲜少挂心凡尘俗务，\n至于除魔去邪，亦非我璇女派之道……”
“我资历尚浅，璇女峰外，纷扰世事，我实不应该过于好奇……”
“‘一明珏’中神女时隐时现，踪迹难寻……\n莫非是不欲看见世间妖魔，令我等除之？”
“我等虽久居璇女峰不出，亦有闻如今妖魔作乱，相枢将现之兆……”
“这些时日，我总觉心有戚戚，难道是这相枢作乱，扰我心念？”
“巫山隐没，神女泣血……\n只要相枢不除，我等便再难参悟‘一明珏’中真义……”
“血海翻波，生灵尽丧，此等浩劫，我璇女一派岂能无动于衷……”
“虽说我派不问峰外之事，可如今这世道，又叫人如何袖手旁观……”
“工欲善其事，必先利其器……\n无论那相枢是否重现，我铸剑山庄之道不曾易改……”
“不知当年太吾传人降那相枢之时，用的可是庄中打制的兵器？”
“相枢之事，我只从老宗匠那儿听得些许，却也不知其中究竟……”
“看来相枢之祸，不日将至……\n我等须加紧打磨兵器，以备不虞……”
“好几位同门的兵刃，都被那相枢爪牙打折了……不想相枢竟如此棘手！”
“近日来到山庄购置兵刃的人是愈发多了……世道竟已如此不太平……”
“相枢封于地下数百载，我铸剑山庄手艺已是大有精进，此战未必没有胜算……”
“都说那相枢刀枪不入，那我等便打上千把刀，万条枪，又当如何？”
“相枢当前，我的锻造手艺却是毫无长进！也只怪自己平日没在炉边下足功夫……”
“相枢？不过旧日传说罢了。我派长生之道，才是重中之重！”
“江湖动乱，那又如何？我派隐于雪山之中，那中原祸乱岂能波及我等？”
“师尊有言：炼丹之道，贵在静心。那些江湖琐事，我从不关心……”
“炼丹长生乃我派夙愿，但如今妖魔横行，只怕前路越发困难重重……”
“相枢之乱，如今竟已波及我空桑山！我派恐已无法独善其身……”
“不知这失心之人可还畏毒？莫要多想，专心炼丹便是……”
“长生丹虽未练成，然以我派药毒之术，也未必不能与那妖魔一较高下……”
“相枢之灾蔓延九州，若世间尽数沦丧，我空桑一脉又能去往何处……”
“长生未得，相枢先至，难道我这条性命便要断送于此……”
“好，好！正是佛爷庇佑，\n中原这一乱，于我等而言何尝不是光复良机……”
“江湖动荡，便有流民来求庇护，自然要多为佛爷呈上些贡品……”
“近来人心不安，我等只好日日催纳贡品，\n可不能让小民们怠慢了佛爷……”
“相枢闹到这般地步，我等复国大计也只好缓一缓了……”
“何必畏惧什么相枢，\n有法王在此护教，小民们只管朝拜便是！”
“如今乱成这样，正应多敛些财物，孝敬佛爷表表诚心……”
“可笑！我金刚宗数百年基业，岂能亡于相枢之手？”
“我等追随法王，自有密宗无量神力加持，也未必怕了那相枢！”
“佛爷保佑，若能躲过这相枢之祸，定当加倍纳贡烧香……”
“听闻中原纷乱，我等上下皆须提防，\n可不能卷入外人的争斗中……”
“外族人自让他们斗去，\n可谁要敢对我们苗疆不利，我定不饶他！”
“自进门起，师父便教我专心修炼，休要理会外族那些纷乱……”
“相枢祸乱若是危及天下，五仙亦难独善其身，须得尽早应对……”
“哼，若非如今相枢势大，可真不想同那些外族人扯上关系……”
“妖魔作乱又如何？我们五仙教凭自己也可抵御，何必倚仗外人！”
“我族世代守护五仙，便是身死此地，也不可失了这片净土！”
“相枢虽然厉害，可真要胆敢来犯，我们五仙的蛊术也不是好惹的！”
“鸟兽也跑了，花木也枯了，我的虫儿们都……呜……”
“界青门眼观六路，耳听八方，\n近来相枢现世之事，我自然早已知晓……”
“近来江湖动荡不安，\n我等在外执行委托之时，亦曾风闻相枢之事……”
“界青门向来只接杀人的委托，\n至于除魔之事，却是一概不知……”
“妖魔祸世，杀伐四起，当今世道，倒是收取委托的好时机……”
“除魔卫道虽非界青所求，但我等亦不能容妖魔在自家的地盘上撒野……”
“押送失心人的差事当真吃力不讨好，不如去接些寻常委托……”
“相枢已是举世皆敌，我界青门少不得接下此单，也同那相枢过几招！”
“我辈既入界青门，便知生死全凭各人本事，乱世之中尤为如此……”
“我自知学艺未精，却也不甘心就这样倒在妖魔脚下……”
“相枢乃是数百年前之妖魔，比起真龙之威，更是不值一提……”
“世人风闻邪魔之名，便惊惶不已，皆是信仰真龙之心不够虔诚……”
“近来江湖流言纷起，与其担忧什么相枢，不如一心一意供奉真龙……”
“伏龙坛虽受真龙庇护，那相枢亦非等闲之辈，不可不早做防备……”
“伏龙坛有真龙护佑，自是所向无敌，即便相枢降临，又有何惧！”
“若是真有天下大乱之日，真龙定会现身救世！”
“眼下真龙降世恐已无望，\n如今之势，唯有凭借手中兵刃，拼出一条血路！”
“如今别无他法，唯有拼死一战……\n但愿往日赤诚，能换得真龙护佑……”
“真龙究竟何时降临……\n我身微力薄，不知还能否得见那一天……”
“近来江湖传言多是关乎相枢，此正是我教兴盛之机……”
“近来江湖多有风波，一切皆是相枢大神之神威所及……”
“我等诚心祭祷，也不知相枢大神何日才能驾临……”
“我教虽是颂扬相枢大神之威，难道相枢大神竟真有降临之势……”
“如今四处皆是相枢大神座下门徒，尽早加入我教，方可得享庇护！”
“相枢大神日渐强盛，我等小辈也好跟着吃香喝辣！”
“相枢出世，我亦自知难逃此劫，如今只好放手一搏了……”
“教中已有不少人死于相枢之手……\n休要欺我血犼无人，我等岂会坐以待毙！”
“听闻相枢降临，教中已是天翻地覆，我等自是不肯再受蒙蔽了……”
“自我奉命严守库房，同门无不鼎力支持，\n我等已于库房内外做足守备，列下阵来，众人功力合于一处，可御强敌，自是万无一失……\n你且莫要与我攀谈，以免误了我的重任……”
