"My Lion Sphere Sect has two great swords and palms! I don't care what kind of demons and monsters they are, I'll cut them all down!"
"Demon chaos, although we have nothing to fear, the surrounding people are also not free from panic, must be sent to pacify..."
"I've heard that a fellow disciple has already been injured by those Xiangshu minions! Hmph, sooner or later I'll have to help my brothers get justice!"
"I've recently learned a new and wonderful move, that Xiangshu, no matter how great his skill is, will definitely not be able to do this style!"
"Our ancestors sacrificed their lives for the country, how dare we be ashamed of our ancestors? \nThe day that Xiangshu comes out will be the day that I, the Lion Sphere Sect, will serve!"
"As long as I, the Lion Phase Sect, have a single breath of life left, then the Xiangshu will never think of taking half a step into the frontier!"
"Let that Xiangshu's skill be heavenly, the Sect Master will surely lead us to break the enemy invaders, we only need to follow the orders!"
"Since successive generations of Taiwu in addition to the devil, the Xiangshu has been hidden for a long time, is the world of the party, and should be robbed..."
"Demons are only a hundred years old, and in the eyes of an immortal, it's just a snap of the fingers..."
"The Xiangshu has been buried underground for a long time, and we have not yet succeeded in our quest to ascend to immortality, so why should we ask about the affairs of the underground?"
"The danger of the Xiangshu must be removed as soon as possible, otherwise I fear that it will hinder our ladder to immortality..."
"Recently, when I traveled around in the clouds, I repeatedly saw demons hurting people, could it be that the phase center is really descending into the world?"
"If we wait until we become immortals, then we will come back to pacify this scourge of the phase center, I think it will be as easy as a palm..."
"The calamity of the Xiangshu is finally approaching, but the mountain is also difficult to be complete alone, the only way to deal with it is to use immortal spells..."
"I only hate that I have failed to seek the immortal way, although I have the intention to subdue the devil, I don't know if I can have the strength to spare..."
"Now that the Xiangshu is current, I'm afraid the only way to save the world is for an immortal to come down to earth..."
"The Xiangshu is indeed non-trivial, but the matter of drilling 'Jade Mirror'should likewise not be put down..."
"We have been living in the Goddess Peak for a long time, seldom worry about the mundane affairs of the mortal world,\n As for getting rid of the devil to remove the evil, it is also not the way of my Xuan Women's Sect... "
"My seniority is still shallow, and outside of Xuan Nu Peak, with all the tumultuous world affairs, I really shouldn't be too curious..."
"'Jade Mirror'In the goddess of God sometimes hidden and sometimes appear, the trace is difficult to find...\n Could it be that they do not want to see the world's demons, so that we get rid of them?"
"Although we have been living in the Xuan female peak for a long time, we have also heard that nowadays the demons are in turmoil, and the Xiangshu will appear as an omen..."
"These days, I always feel that my heart is in a state of solidarity, could it be that this phase center is in turmoil, disturbing my mind?"
"The Witch Mountain is hidden, the Goddess weeps blood...\n As long as the phase center is not removed, it will be difficult for us to realize the true meaning of 'Jade Mirror'in... "
"The sea of blood is turning over, all living beings are lost, such a catastrophe, how can I, the Xuan Nu School, be indifferent..."
"Although our faction does not ask about matters outside the peak, but nowadays this world, and how to tell people to stand by and watch..."
"If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools...\nWhether that Xiangshu reappears or not, the way of my Sword Casting Villa will not be changed..."
"I wonder if the weapons used by Taiwu's heir when he descended on that Xiangshu were those made in the Zhuang?"
"The matter of the Xiangshu, I only heard something from the old patriarchal craftsman, but I don't know what is actually in it..."
"It seems that the scourge of the Xiangshu will arrive soon...\n we must step up our efforts to polish our weapons in case of a disaster..."
"Several fellow disciples'blades were broken by that Xiangshu's minions... I don't want the Xiangshu to be so tricky!"
"Recently the people who come to the mountain villa to buy blades are more and more... the world has been so unpeaceful..."
"Xiangshu sealed in the ground for hundreds of years, my sword casting mountain village craft has been greatly improved, this battle may not be no chance of victory..."
"It is said that that Xiangshu is invulnerable to swords and spears, so what if we fight with a thousand swords and ten thousand spears?"
"When the Xiangshu is current, my forging craftsmanship is unimproved! I only blame myself for not putting in enough effort at the fireside on weekdays..."
" XiangShu? It's just an old legend. The Way of Eternal Life of our sect is the top priority!"
"So what if the jianghu is in turmoil? Our sect is hidden in the snowy mountains, so how can the turmoil in the Central Plains affect us?"
"Master has said that the way of alchemy is valued in meditation. Those Jianghu trivialities, I never cared about..."
"Alchemy and longevity is the long-cherished wish of our sect, but nowadays demons are rampant, and I'm afraid that the road ahead will become more and more difficult..."
"The chaos of the Xiangshu has now even spread to my Empyrean Mountain! I'm afraid that our sect can no longer stand alone..."
"I don't know if this person who has lost his mind is still afraid of poison? Don't think too much, just concentrate on refining pills..."
"Although the Longevity Dan has not been practiced, but with my school's art of medicine and poison, it may not be impossible to compete with that demon..."
"The plague of the Xiangshu is spreading throughout the nine states, if the world falls as far as it can go, where can I go with my Khongsang lineage..."
"Eternal life has not yet been attained, but the Xiangshu has arrived first, is this life of mine to be cut short here..."
"Good, good! It is the Buddha blessing,\n this chaos in the Central Plains, in our case is not a good opportunity to recover..."
"When the rivers and lakes are in turmoil, there are stragglers who come to seek refuge, so it is natural to present more tribute to the Buddha..."
"Recently, people's hearts are restless, we have to press for tribute day after day,\n can't let the little people slow down the Buddha..."
"The Xiangshu has made such a mess, so we will have to slow down our plan to restore the country..."
"Why be afraid of any Xiangshu, \n there is a Dharma King here to protect the religion, the little people just worship!"
"Now that the chaos is like this, it is time to collect more wealth and honor the Buddha to show your sincerity..."
"Ridiculous! My Vajra Sect's foundation of hundreds of years, how can it perish at the hands of the Xiangshu?"
"We follow His Holiness and have our own tantric immeasurable divine power to add, and we may not be afraid of that Xiangshu!"
"Buddha blessing, if I can escape the disaster of this Xiangshu, I will surely double the tribute and burn incense..."
"I heard that the Central Plains are in turmoil, and we must be on our guard up and down the line,\n can't get involved in outsiders'fights..."
"Foreigners since let them fight, \n but whoever dares to be unfavorable to our Miaojiang, I will not spare him!"
"Since I entered the gate, my master has taught me to concentrate on cultivation and to ignore the chaos of the foreign clans..."
"If the Xiangshu scourge jeopardizes the world, the Five Immortals will not be able to stand alone, and must be dealt with as soon as possible..."
"Hmph, if not for the fact that nowadays the Xiangshu is powerful, can really do not want to get involved with those foreigners..."
"So what if the demons are in turmoil? We, the Five Immortals Sect, can defend ourselves with ourselves, so why rely on outsiders!"
"My clan has been guarding the Five Immortals for generations, and even if we die here, we must not lose this pure land!"
"Although the Xiangshu is powerful, if it really dares to come and commit a crime, the compulsion of our Five Immortals is not something to be messed with!"
"And the birds and the beasts have fled, and the flowers and the trees are withered, and my worms are... ooo..."
"Boundary green door eyes to watch the six roads, ears to listen to the winds,\n recent Xiangshu present thing, I naturally have long known..."
"Recently, the jianghu is in turmoil,\n we are outside the execution of the commission, but also heard about the matter of the Xiangshu..."
"The Boundary Green Sect has always only taken on commissions to kill people,\n as for the matter of removing demons, it is all unknown..."
"Demon scourge, killing in all directions, today's world is a good time to collect commissions..."
"Although getting rid of demons and defending the way is not what Boundary Qing seeks, we also cannot allow demons to spread their wildness on our own territory..."
"The errand of escorting the lost hearted person is really laborious and unappealing, why don't you go and take some ordinary commissions..."
"The Xiangshu is already the enemy of the world, so I, the Realm Green Sect, have no choice but to take this order and have a few moves with that Xiangshu as well!"
"Since my generation has entered the Boundary Green Sect, we know that life and death depend on each person's ability, and this is especially true in a chaotic world..."
"I know that I have not yet mastered the art of learning, but I am not willing to fall at the feet of the demons like this..."
"The Xiangshu is a demon from hundreds of years ago, and is even more worthless than the power of a true dragon..."
"When the world hears the name of evil, they are terrified, all because their faith in the true dragon is not pious enough..."
"Recently the rivers and lakes have been rumored, instead of worrying about what Xiangshu, it is better to single-mindedly make offerings to the True Dragon..."
"Although the Voltron altar is sheltered by the true dragon, that Xiangshu is also not an idle person, it is not possible not to make precautions early..."
"The Voltron Altar is blessed by a true dragon, so it is invincible, even if the Xiangshu descends, what is there to fear!"
"If there really is a day of great chaos in the world, the True Dragon will surely show up to save the day!"
"Right now the true dragon descends to the world is afraid that there is no hope, \n the situation today, the only way to rely on the hands of the blade, to fight out a bloody road!"
"Now there is no other way but to fight to the death...\n but I hope that the bare sincerity of the past will be exchanged for the blessing of the true dragon..."
"When exactly will the true dragon descend...\n I'm so weak that I don't know if I'll be able to see that day..."
"Recently, the rumors in the jianghu are mostly about the phase center, this is exactly the opportunity for our religion to prosper..."
"There has been much turmoil in the jianghu lately, all because of the divine power of the Xiangshu Great God..."
"We sincerely offer prayers, and we don't know when the Great God of the Xiangshu will be able to come..."
"Although our religion celebrates the might of the Xiangshu Great God, could it be that the Xiangshu Great God actually has the power to descend..."
"Nowadays, there are disciples under the Xiangshu Great God everywhere, so join our sect as soon as possible in order to enjoy shelter!"
"As the Xiangshu Great Spirit grows stronger by the day, it's good for us juniors to follow suit!"
"The Xiangshu is out of the world, I also know that it is difficult to escape this calamity, now I have to let go of the fight..."
"Many people in the sect have already died at the hands of the Xiangshu...\nDon't bully me Blood Harvest has no one, we will not sit and wait for death!"
"Hearing that the Xiangshu has descended and that the Sect has been turned upside down, we have refused to be hoodwinked again..."
"I have been ordered to guard the treasury, and all my fellow disciples have given me their full support,\n we have already made sufficient preparations inside and outside the treasury, and have set up a formation, where all our powers are combined in one place, so that we can defend ourselves against the strongest enemies, and it's a sure thing...\nYou don't want to talk to me, so as not to miss the important task I have to perform..."
