Just
For you as a just warrior there's only black or white, right or wrong.\nThe evil must be punished, and morality shall be encouraged, for there's only one way of being human!
Different wills, only so...
If the Tao does not agree, it is really difficult to force it...
I have decided, you do not have a soft heart...
Kind
You are compassionate, benevolent, and behaves noble.\nDedicating yourself to others, and repaying grievances with virtue. Your sense of morality is precious as gold and jade.
I am only afraid that you hurt people and hurt yourself...
And you take care of yourself...
I am ashamed of you...
Even
You are moderate, unbiased, and mediocre.\nEverything goes with the flow, but prefers balance and harmony. You may finally tolerate everything in the world, for there is a lack of distinction between righteousness and evil in your heart.
Things happen for a reason, you can't blame me...
The world has always been difficult to be in two...
This is also a necessity...
Rebel
You are rebellious, straightforward, intolerant, and distort facts.\nHaving opposite views and practices with most people.
And let me see a good show...
This is what makes it interesting...
Why don't I come and have some fun...
Egoist
You are egoistic. Bullying the weakers, crusading the different ones, colluding with the villains, and deceiving kind people.\nMercenary is ruthless, for profit is the only thing that matters.
I'm having trouble making things work with you...
I just have another big plan...
I have my own plan for this matter...
