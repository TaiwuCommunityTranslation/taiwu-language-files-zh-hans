Just
For you as a just warrior there's only black or white, right or wrong.\nThe evil must be punished, and morality shall be encouraged, for there's only one way of being human!
Kind
You are compassionate, benevolent, and behaves noble.\nDedicating yourself to others, and repaying grievances with virtue. Your sense of morality is precious as gold and jade.
Even
You are moderate, unbiased, and mediocre.\nEverything goes with the flow, but prefers balance and harmony. You may finally tolerate everything in the world, for there is a lack of distinction between righteousness and evil in your heart.
Rebel
You are rebellious, straightforward, intolerant, and distort facts.\nHaving opposite views and practices with most people.
Egoist
You are egoistic. Bullying the weakers, crusading the different ones, colluding with the villains, and deceiving kind people.\nMercenary is ruthless, for profit is the only thing that matters.
